      <p>
        The doctoral research informing Vivartana's work adopts a qualitative-heavy, multi-stage mixed methods design to understand how organisations function under stress, ambiguity, and disruption.
      </p>
      <p>
        The methodology is designed to explore organisational behaviour from multiple perspectives and progressively build a deeper understanding of the properties that shape collective response under pressure.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-serif text-thought mb-6">Overall Approach</h2>
      <p class="text-thought/75 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">The study follows a staged approach:</p>
      <ul class="space-y-3">
        <% stagedApproach.forEach((stage) => { %>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-serif text-thought mb-6">Multi-Level Perspective</h2>
      <p class="text-thought/75 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">For each participating organisation, perspectives are gathered from:</p>
      <ul class="space-y-3 mb-6">
        <% organisationLevels.forEach((level) => { %>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-serif text-thought mb-5">Connection to Vivartana's Practice</h2>
      <p class="text-thought/75 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The ORI Scan(TM) and the focus on Organisational Stress Response draw inspiration from this research design.
      </p>
      <p class="text-thought/75 text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">They translate research thinking into structured organisational engagement.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-serif text-thought mb-5">Evolving Nature of the Design</h2>
      <p class="text-thought/75 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        As with most exploratory research, the design is expected to evolve as insights emerge from early stages of inquiry.
      </p>
      <p class="text-thought/75 text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        This flexibility allows the research to remain grounded in observed organisational realities rather than fixed assumptions.

      <p class="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The methodology is intended to build a rigorous, evidence-informed understanding of how organisations can progressively strengthen their ability to function coherently when tested.
