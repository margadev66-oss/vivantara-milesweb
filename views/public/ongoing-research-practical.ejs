      <p>While the research is ongoing, its direction already points toward important practical questions for organisations.</p>
      <p>
        At its heart lies a simple idea: the way organisations behave under stress is shaped by deeper internal properties that are often overlooked in routine operations.
      </p>
      <p>Understanding and strengthening these properties has significant practical implications.</p>

      <div class="space-y-4 text-thought/75 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        <p>In fast-changing, AI-enabled, and high-pressure environments, organisations need more than process efficiency.</p>
        <p>They need the ability to function coherently when tested.</p>
        <p>This research aims to understand how that capability can be observed and progressively strengthened.</p>
