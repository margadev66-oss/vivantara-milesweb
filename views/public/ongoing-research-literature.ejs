      <p>The doctoral research informing Vivartana's work is in its early stages. The formal literature review is yet to be undertaken.</p>
      <p>
        However, the research is expected to engage with established bodies of knowledge in organisational behaviour, leadership, resilience, cognitive diversity, and quality management to better understand how organisations function under stress and disruption.

      <p class="text-thought/75 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The aim of the literature review will be to identify how existing research explains behaviour at the level of individuals and teams, and to explore the relative gap in understanding how stress reveals deeper organisational properties.

        This review will form the academic foundation for the ongoing research and its practical applications through Vivartana.
