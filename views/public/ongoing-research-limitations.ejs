      <p>
        Every research study operates within defined boundaries shaped by its design, scope, and context. These boundaries do not represent weaknesses, but rather the limits within which the study's findings are intended to be interpreted.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-serif text-thought mb-6">Study Limitations</h2>
      <p class="text-thought/75 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The following limitations arise naturally from the chosen research design:
      </p>
      <div class="space-y-6">
        <% studyLimitations.forEach((item) => { %>
          <div>

            <p class="text-thought/75 text-lg leading-relaxed"><%= item.description %></p>
          </div>
        <% }) %>
      </div>
      <p class="text-thought/75 text-lg leading-relaxed mt-8">
        These limitations define the boundaries within which the findings of the study are interpreted and applied.

    <section class="border border-warmth/20 bg-white p-8 md:p-10 mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-serif text-thought mb-6">Future Directions</h2>
      <p class="text-thought/75 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">Future research building on this work may explore:</p>
      <ul class="space-y-3">
        <% futureDirections.forEach((direction) => { %>
          <li class="text-thought/80 text-lg leading-relaxed"><%= direction %></li>

      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-serif mb-5">Closing</h2>
      <p class="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Recognising these boundaries ensures that the research remains transparent, rigorous, and open to further development in understanding how organisations function under pressure and how they can progressively strengthen their operating maturity.
